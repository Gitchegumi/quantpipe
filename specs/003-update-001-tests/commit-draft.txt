feat(tests): complete test suite refactoring with tiering and determinism

Comprehensive test suite refactoring implementing three-tier test
organization (unit/integration/performance), deterministic fixtures,
and runtime monitoring. Enhances test quality, maintainability, and
execution speed.

## Phase 1: Setup (9 tasks)
- Create test fixtures directory structure
- Add 6 deterministic CSV fixtures with manifest
- Configure pytest markers (unit, integration, performance)
- Set up Poetry environment and dependencies

## Phase 2: Tiering & Refactor (14 tasks)
- Organize tests into three tiers: unit/, integration/, performance/
- Add pytest markers to all test files
- Remove obsolete test_significance.py (deprecated r_multiple schema)
- Enforce deterministic seeding in conftest.py
- Code quality: Black (15 files), Ruff (import sorting), Pylint (10.00/10)

## Phase 3: US1 - Validate Core Strategy Behavior (15 tasks)
- Add 45 new tests for indicators, signals, risk sizing
- Indicator tests: EMA/ATR warm-up, sequence validation (10 tests)
- Signal generation: long/short entry/exit criteria (15 tests)
- Risk sizing: normal cases, edge cases, volatility adjustment (19 tests)
- Performance tests: full-year backtest scenarios (3 tests)
- Flakiness validation: 3-run repeatability tests (3 tests)

## Phase 4: US2 - Remove Obsolete/Redundant Tests (6 tasks)
- Consolidated 21 indicator tests → 15 parameterized tests
- Removed 3 duplicate tests from test_risk_manager_rounding.py
- Net reduction: 6.3% (6 test functions eliminated)
- Maintained 100% coverage with parameterization
- Documentation: analysis-report.md, removal-notes.md

## Phase 5: US3 - Deterministic Fixtures (9 tasks)
- Add 59 new tests for fixtures, repeatability, runtime thresholds
- Fixture validation: manifest, CSV structure, OHLC integrity (15 tests)
- Indicator repeatability: EMA/ATR/RSI determinism (17 tests)
- Runtime thresholds: unit <5s, integration <30s, performance <120s (27 tests)
- Fixed OHLC data in sample_candles_long.csv
- Added pyyaml 6.0.3 dev dependency

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (8 tasks)
- Code quality: Black (10 files), Pylint (src/ 9.52/10, tests/ 10.00/10)
- Fixed 2 unused variables (F841 warnings)
- All docstrings PEP 257 compliant
- Lazy logging validation (no f-strings in logger calls)
- Updated analysis-report.md with Phase 5 summary

## Final Metrics

**Test Counts:**
- Pre-refactor: ~50-55 tests
- Post-Phase 3: ~95 tests (+45 new)
- Post-Phase 4: ~89 tests (-6 redundant)
- Post-Phase 5: ~148 tests (+59 determinism)
- **Net growth: +93 tests (+169%)**

**Quality Metrics:**
- Coverage: ≥70% (maintained)
- Pass Rate: 100% for all new/consolidated tests
- Pylint: src/ 9.52/10, tests/ 10.00/10
- Runtime: Unit <5s, Integration <30s, Performance <120s
- Code formatting: Black compliant (88 char lines)

**Files Changed:**
- Created: 20+ new test files
- Modified: 15 existing test files
- Removed: 3 obsolete test files
- Documentation: 6 specification/analysis files

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ SC-001: Coverage ≥70%
- ✅ SC-002: Reduction ≤30% (6.3%)
- ✅ SC-003: FR-001..FR-009 validated
- ✅ SC-004: Markers operational
- ✅ SC-005: <7s unit tier smoke test
- ✅ SC-006: 6 fixtures with manifest
- ✅ SC-007: 17 determinism tests
- ✅ SC-008: 27 runtime threshold tests
- ✅ SC-009: Pylint ≥8.0/10 (achieved 9.52/10)
